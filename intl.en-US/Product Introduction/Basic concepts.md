# Basic concepts {#concept_ndj_1vv_tdb .concept}

## The basic work flow of Quick BI is as follows. {#section_nq4_kvv_tdb .section}

1.  Create a data source.
2.  Create a dataset.

## The basic components are as follows. {#section_jgv_qvv_tdb .section}

-   Data Source
-   Datasets
-   Worksheet \(Quick BI Basic\)
-   Workbook \(Quick BI Pro\)
-   Dashboards

## Data Source {#section_cgt_vvv_tdb .section}

You can use data sources  to provide data to Quick BI.  Quick BI supports multiple ways to add data sources:

-   From cloud database
-   From external database
-   Upload local files \(personal workspace only\)

For more information, see [Create a cloud data source](../../../../reseller.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Data source management/Create a cloud data source.md#) and [Create a data source from external database](../../../../reseller.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Data source management/Create a data source from external database.md#), and [Upload local files](../../../../reseller.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Data source management/Upload local files.md#).

## Dataset {#section_l5h_rwv_tdb .section}

You can create tables of different data sources as data sets. then edit, move, or delete a dataset.

For more information about how to create a dataset, see [Create a dataset](../../../../reseller.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Dataset management/Create a dataset.md#).

## Dashboards {#section_uf2_1yv_tdb .section}

Dashboards use a more flexible tile layout to show interactions between data. A dashboard not only visualizes data but also supports data filtering and query and multiple data display modes to highlight the key fields of data.

Dashboard supports two kinds of display mode.
