You can add or import a data source to create a dataset. For more information about how to add and import a data source, see [Create a cloud data source](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Data modeling/Data source management/Create cloud data sources.md), [Create a data source from external database](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Data modeling/Data source management/Create a user-created data source.md), and [Upload local files](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Data modeling/Data source management/Upload local files.md).

After you create a dataset, you can create a dashboard to visualize the dataset. For more information about how to create a dashboard, see [Use dashboard to create charts](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Create dashboards/Create charts/Create charts in a dashboard.md).
