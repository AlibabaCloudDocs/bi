# Metric analysis {#concept_183353 .concept}

You can use metric analysis to view the trends and outliers of data. Currently, supported analysis tools include Auxiliary Line, Trendline, Prediction, and Anomaly Detection. Trendline, Prediction, and Anomaly Detection only apply to Quick BI Enterprise Standard.

Create a dashboard before you use metric analysis. For more information, see [Create a dashboard](../../../../reseller.en-US/Quick Start/Create a report/Create dashboards.md#).

## Auxiliary lines {#section_9aq_dd9_utv .section}

You can add an auxiliary line to view the difference between the value of a measure and the value shown by the auxiliary line. The value shown by an auxiliary is either a fixed value or an aggregate value. Aggregate values includes average, maximum, minimum, and median values.

1.  On the edit page of a dashboard, choose **Graphic Design** \> **Advanced** and choose **Metric Analysis** \> **Auxiliary line**.
2.  In the Auxiliary Line dialog box, click Add Auxiliary Line. Select a value type for the auxiliary line to be created.

## Trendlines {#section_83c_r9e_7f9 .section}

A trendline displays the trend of current data. Types of trendlines include Intelligent, Linear, Logarithmic, Exponential, Polynomial, and Power.

1.  On the edit page of a dashboard, choose **Graphic Design** \> **Advanced** and choose **Metric Analysis** \> **Trendline**.
2.  In the Trendline dialog box, click Add Trendline. Select a measure, a trendline type, and the number of subsequent periods for which to predict trends.

## Prediction {#section_flr_0bk_bu9 .section}

You can add a predicted metric to view the trend of current data and predict the trend.

1.  On the edit page of a dashboard, choose **Graphic Design** \> **Advanced** and choose **Metric Analysis** \> **Prediction**.
2.  In the Prediction dialog box, click Add Predicted Metric. Select a measure and a color for the line.

## Exception detection {#section_nlq_plx_stq .section}

You can add a detected metric to view the outliers of the current data.

1.  On the edit page of a dashboard, choose **Graphic Design** \> **Advanced** and choose **Metric Analysis** \> **Anomaly Detection**.
2.  In the Anomaly Detection dialog box, click Add Detected Metric. Select a measure.
