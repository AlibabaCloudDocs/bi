# Remove the members of an organization {#task_g3h_4tc_5db .task}

Administrators can remove the members from an organization.

Removing members cannot be reversed. Therefore, administrators need to re-add members to the organization after removal. Be careful with the remove operation.

1.   Log on to the Quick BI console. 
2.  Choose **Settings** \> **Org Units** \> **Members**. 
3.   Click **Remove** in the Actions column for the member that you want to remove. 
4.   Click **OK** to complete removing the member.
