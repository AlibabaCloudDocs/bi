# Create a user group {#concept_flv_wnn_jgb .concept}

Members in an organization may belong to different departments, such as the sales, operations, and technology departments. They may also have different roles, such as analysts, project managers, and project directors. You can create multiple user groups for these members. A member can be added to multiple user groups. You can then grant these user groups the access permission to datasets and BI portals as needed.

1.  Log on to the Quick BI console.
2.  Choose **Settings** \> **Organization** \> **User Groups**.
3.  On the user groups page, click the **Add Child Group** icon.
