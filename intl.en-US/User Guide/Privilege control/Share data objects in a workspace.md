# Share data objects in a workspace {#task_rzg_tmy_5db .task}

Quick BI supports sharing workbooks, dashboards, and portals in a workspace. Shared data objects are **read-only** for other Alibaba Cloud accounts and RAM users. Other Alibaba Cloud accounts and RAM users do not have permission to modify, delete or save the data objects.

Only the owner of the data objects and administrators of the workspace have permission to share the data objects. Currently, data objects can only be shared with Alibaba Cloud accounts and RAM users within the same organization.

If the Works can be authorized check box is cleared for the workspace, then the data objects in this workspace cannot be shared.
