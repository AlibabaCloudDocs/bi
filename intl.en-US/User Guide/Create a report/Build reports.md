# Build reports {#concept_egy_s5w_5db .concept}

The Report Building Service \(RBS\) supports the What You See Is What You Get \(WYSIWYG\) feature for designing data applications. You can use widgets and templates to generate charts for PC users and mobile users. Charts such as the dashboard, workbook, and classic workbook can be shared, published, and transferred to allow readers to see the created charts.

**Note:** The classic workbook is a beta feature and is not supported in future releases. Additionally, the classic workbook does not support custom group fields, data type conversion, snowflake schemas association, or database data association across different sources.
