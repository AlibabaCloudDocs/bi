Quick BI categorizes the data in a dataset into dimensions and measures based on certain rules. Typically, the String type data is categorized as dimensions. The Double and Bigint type data is categorized as measures. You can select fields from dimensions and measures, and add them to rows or columns in a workbook. You can also perform data analysis by setting filter conditions.
