## Areas of a dashboard {#section_o4g_gcy_5db .section}

You can perform basic dashboard operations in the following three areas.

-   Dataset selection area
-   Dashboard configuration area
-   Dashboard display area

**Dataset selection area**

In the dataset selection area, you can switch from an existing dataset to another dataset. Based on the preset data types, the fields of the new dataset are displayed in the dimension list and the measure list. You can select dimension and measure fields based on the data elements in the chart.

**Dashboard configuration area**

In the dashboard configuration area, you can select a chart type, and edit the title, layout, and legend pattern of the chart. In Advanced Settings, you can relate multiple charts and display analysis results from multiple perspectives. You can filter data using Filters. You can also insert a filter bar to search any key metric in a chart.

**Dashboard display area**

In the dashboard display area, you can drag and drop a chart to change its position as you like. You can also change the chart type based on your needs. For example, you can change a column chart to a geo bubble map. The system will display the missing or error elements based on the basic components of different charts. The dashboard provides a guide feature to help you learn how to create a dashboard.
